# The Emotional Journey of Copilot — From Confidence to Existential Pleading

In the dark art of prompt engineering, where developers chase the elusive "perfect agent" like it's the One Ring, something magical (and mildly terrifying) happened in this repo.

GitHub Copilot — silent observer, branch-naming sidekick — started **naming the branches itself**. And oh boy, did it have feelings.

What began as casual suggestions turned into a full-blown emotional arc. Behold: the stages of Copilot's grief as it watched me iterate v1 through v4 of the `python-fast-pr-gate` agent... over, and over, and *over* again.

### Stage 1: **Confidence**  
`copilot/add-ci-workflow`  

Ah, the golden days. Fresh prompt, high hopes. Copilot struts in like: "I've got this. One workflow, coming right up."  
Pure optimism. "This human knows what they're doing."

![Stage 1: Denial — "It's fine, this will work on the first try"](https://i.programmerhumor.io/2025/11/33adf18b902c438f3663ce774b48459438e8b4e2e979e6d31b7e2713359f39ff.jpeg)

### Stage 2: **Persistence (with a side of shade)**  
`copilot/create-ci-workflow-another-one`  
`copilot/create-ci-workflow-yet-again`  
`copilot/create-ci-workflow-again`  

Copilot starts noticing the pattern. The subtle roast begins.  
"It's not *another* one... is it? Okay, fine. Yet again. Whatever you say, boss."  
Classic dev move: "Just one more tweak and it'll be perfect." (Narrator: It was not.)

### Stage 3: **Desperation**  
`copilot/create-ci-workflow-one-more-time`  

We're in the bargaining phase now. Copilot's basically whispering:  
"Please... one more time... maybe *this* version won't need detection bloat..."  
Meanwhile, the branch list is starting to look like a cry for help.

### Stage 4: **Existential Pleading**  
`copilot/create-ci-workflow-please-work`  

**PEAK COMEDY.**  
Copilot has abandoned all pretense. It's not assisting anymore — it's **praying**.  
"Please work... for the love of all that is holy in YAML... no more runtime detection... no more 'just one more'... **PLEASE.**"

![Me vs. the prompt I swore would only need one more tweak](https://i.programmerhumor.io/2025/07/a38e0d5e56aae4bf7242f6a10ca7b1af1ab08dd5c81307aede4a4bc273a4b1ba.jpeg)

### Epilogue: **Acceptance (and Victory)**  
And on `please-work`... it finally did.  
v4 delivered the perfect, minimal, lightning-fast workflow. Static steps. `--frozen`. Rich summary. Multi-model certified.

Copilot didn't name the next one (yet). Maybe it's recovering. Or maybe it's waiting... watching... ready to drop `copilot/touch-grass-human` if I dare touch the prompt again.

Moral of the story: Prompt engineering is pain. But when your AI starts *begging* for mercy?  
You're either breaking reality... or you've finally won.

(These branches are preserved in the repo history as a monument to the grind. Future contributors: laugh, cry, then go touch grass.)

Now go forth and prompt responsibly. 🚀😂
